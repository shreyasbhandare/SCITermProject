					<a id="tool1"></a><h2>Loomio</h2>
					<p><label>Loomio is decision-making software to assist groups with collaborative decision-making processes. It is a free software web application. Users initiate discussions and put up proposals. As discussions progress the group receives feedback on a proposal through an up-datable pie chart.In 2014, they raised over $100,000 via a crowdfunding effort, to develop Loomio 1.0, with support for mobile phones and other enhancements. It is built by a core of group of developers based in Wellington, New Zealand. There are contributors to the project from around the world.</label></p>

					<a id="tool2"></a><h2>Scribe Framework</h2>
					<p><label>Scribe is a highly configurable, open source framework for setting up community transcription projects around handwritten or OCR-resistant texts. Scribe is particularly geared toward digital humanities, library, and citizen science projects seeking to extract highly structured, normalizable data from a set of digitized materials (e.g. historical manuscripts, account ledgers, catalog cards, or maritime logbooks). 

					Scribe is not a crowdsourcing project in a box, but it establishes the foundation for a developer to configure and launch a project far more easily than if starting from scratch. Informed by previous crowdsourcing efforts by NYPL Labs and Zooniverse, Scribe handles many of the technical operations common across transcription projects and offers highly configurable task flows and schemas, allowing project administrators to focus on the specifics of their materials and audience.</label></p>

					<a id="tool3"></a><h2>ArchiveSpace</h2>
					<p><label>ArchivesSpace is an open source, web application for managing archives information.  The application is designed to support core functions in archives administration such as accessioning; description and arrangement of processed materials including analog, hybrid, and born-digital content; management of authorities (agents and subjects) and rights; and reference service.  The application supports collection management through collection management records, tracking of events, and a growing number of  administrative reports.  The application also functions as a metadata authoring tool, enabling the generation of EAD, MARCXML, MODS, Dublin Core, and METS formatted data.</label></p>
					<p>Tip : A default configuration of ArchivesSpace has “Help” links that go to the members-only documentation. You can suppress the Help settings by changing the options in archivesspace/config/config.rb. <a href="http://www.dcplumer.com/2014/07/using-archivesspace/"  target="_blank">Click Here For More Tips</a><br>

					<a id="tool4"></a><h2>Omeka</h2>
					<p><label>Omeka is a free, flexible, and open source web-publishing platform for the display of library, museum, archives, and scholarly collections and exhibitions. Its “five-minute setup” makes launching an online exhibition as easy as launching a blog. It is designed with non-IT specialists in mind, allowing users to focus on content and interpretation rather than programming. It brings Web 2.0 technologies and approaches to academic and cultural websites to foster user interaction and participation. It makes top-shelf design easy with a simple and flexible templating system. Its robust open-source developer and user communities underwrite Omeka’s stability and sustainability.</label></p>

					<a id="tool5"></a><h2>VuFind</h2>
					<p><label>VuFind is a library resource portal designed and developed for libraries by libraries. VuFind is completely modular so you can implement just the basic system, or all of the components. And since it's open source, you can modify the modules to best fit your need or you can add new modules to extend your resource offerings. VuFind runs on Solr Energy. Apache Solr, an open source search engine, offers amazing performance and scalability to allow for VuFind to respond to search queries in milliseconds time. It has the ability to be distributed if you need to spread the load of the catalog over many servers or in a server farm environment.</label></p>
					<p>Tip : Library Administrators can see how many people are viewing your categories and clicking on titles within the catalog to gauge effectiveness. <a href="https://info.marmot.org/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=125"  target="_blank">Click Here For More Tips</a><br>
